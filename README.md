# OpenCore (0.9.5) EFI for HP 15-da0326tu (i3-7100U / HD 620)

This is a working OpenCore EFI setup for the **HP 15-da0326tu** laptop running **macOS Ventura**. Should work with Monterey and Big Sur with minimal adjustments.

## üîß System Specifications

- **iGPU**: Intel HD Graphics 620

## ‚úÖ Working

## üö´ Not Working

- **WiFi**: Realtek 8723DE is not supported in macOS. Replace with a compatible 1x1 A+E Key card if you can find (couldnt find any compatible cards that match the criteria myself) or use a USB WiFi adapter.
- **HDMI**: No output, not functional at all.
- Anything else? Let me know!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Disable Secure Boot in BIOS.
- Generate your own serials with [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) before using.
- Tested with macOS Ventura & macOS Monterey. Adjust kexts if using an older OS version.
- Generate your own RTC-AWAC.aml SSDT using SSDTTime incase stuck in parsing error (Don't forget to patch after generating!)
